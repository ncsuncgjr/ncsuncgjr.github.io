                    <h3><b>Modbuster</b></h3>
                    My main specialty is bannerz, greeting cardz, business cardz, and any kind of GRAFX D'signz.
                    <br>
                    <br> I helped co-author two of the bestselling books, "Teach Yourself MS-Paint in 21 Days" and "Teach Yourself MS-Bob in 21 Days".
                    <br>
                    <br> I am a member of the HTML Writer's Guild, EXPERT HTML WRITER'S RING and a charter member of the "mspaint ROCKS" community.
                    <br>
                    <br> In 2003, I created "the500k.org", a contest for grafx pro's to build the best and most awesome websight in under 500kb (yes, KILOBYTES). This is the ultimate test of an elite d'signer's skillz: imagine having to fit your websight and then ANOTHER COPY of your websight on one 5.25" disk. Tt is not for the faint of heart - PRO'S ONLY!
                    <br>
                    <br> I have written, consulted and co-written many various and numerous plugins for MSPAINT, including the "ALIASER" (a de-anti-aliaser), the innovative and hi-tech "Tree Fattener v2.0", and the "Lens Flare Drop Shadower" (if you've ever seen a lens flare with a drop shadow, and who hasn't, chances are it was done with the "Lens Flare Drop Shadower").
                    <br>
                    <br> My hobbies include tai bo and MAKING YOU LOOK GOOD.

                    "I have been there from the very beginning of the internet" says Pigasus, "I just wasn't very interested until now."
                    <br>
                    <br> Pigasus is the ultra-rad E-persona of a harbinger of the info-superhighway. In the early 80's Pigasus made one million dollars harvesting fax numbers and selling them to toner companies, who then started the fax-spam advertising craze, the forerunner of today's e-mail "Spam" technique.
                    <br>
                    <br> "I believe Cyber D-sign Clan to be the catalyst of the bleeding edge thinking of the future. Web pages have grown complacent and most are satisfied with being only 'cutting edge'. Our website is Bleeding Edge and will stay that way."
                    <br>
                    <br> Pigasus learned his chops on BBS Blackjack and C64, perfecting his chops with the GEOS Operating system. He maintains to this day "It was the last great OS".
                    <br>
                    <br> Pigasus is excited to be on the winning team.
